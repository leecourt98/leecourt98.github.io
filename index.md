# Welcome to Courtney Lee's homepage! 

Hello! My name is Courtney Lee and I’m interested in crafting stories with and from data. I enjoy drawing from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives to show impacts for broad audiences. My most frequently used methods are statistical data analysis (descriptive and regressions) and historical research, which I then carefully weave together to form a narrative.

Most days of the week, I am a research associate at the Public Policy Institute of California’s Higher Education Center. I study the topics of affordability, access, and completion to and through higher education very closely. Some publications I have written include bits on California’s financial aid, state level strategies to reduce student debt, and non-tuition fees.

Prior to becoming a policy researcher, I worked in evaluation and operations at ScholarMatch, a college access nonprofit based in San Francisco, dabbled in computer vision at an applied mathematics summer program, and interned at the Los Angeles Times’ Data Desk. I hold a BS in mathematics with a minor in statistics from UCLA.
