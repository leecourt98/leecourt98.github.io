I presented my first talk at the North American Cartographic Information Society (NACIS), a cartography conference, back in October. 
There, I presented a quick overview of how I make maps with the statistical language R in my daily practice as a policy researcher. 

My slides may be viewed [here](http://courtneylee.net/nacis-2019/#1), and the video recording may be viewed below (link opens separately):
